To Chillun:

I have some notes/todoes for you based on what you've got now:

Dylan:
	Bootstrap note - I ***love*** the redesign that makes it more bootstrappy. A+. 
	Few quick things:
	1. Can you make your text boxes bootstrap compliant? This means adding the proper class: <input class="form-control" ...>
	2. Can you make all of the radio buttons not selected by default, and make them go back and fill them in if they try to 
		submit without filling everything out? They should be able to switch pages without filling in each button, but if you 
		start them off with default options, they will neglect to do some of them.
	3. Font - the new font is great, can you apply it across the app? Some of the question titles have a different font.
	4. Notes box - "form-control"

Tristan:
	1. On the strategy page, can you make those text boxes bootstrappy? You did it for the other ones, "form-control"
	2. Make sure that they fill out everything. I was able to submit when the radio buttons on the grading page
		weren't all filled out.
	3. Notes box - "form-control"
	4. Fuel page - "Accuracy of Shooter" label should include "(%)" for clarification
	5. Tele-Op page - where do the fuel cycles go? That submitter looks great, but there should be some way where they 
		can see the cycles saving and being kept track of up when they click submit. Ask me if you want ideas.
